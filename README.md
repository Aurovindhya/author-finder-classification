# author-finder-classification

The objective of this project is to produce classification predictions and compare them. Ideally, it is to train a machine that can tell which author the book belongs to when asked. The pros and cons of the chosen algorithms were comprehended by visualizing and analyzing the results. The inferred insights have been shared.

This is the process followed:
1. Data Preparation and Pre-processing
2. Feature Engineering
3. Classification 
4. Evaluation
5. Error analysis

These are the feature engineering models involved:
1. Bag-of-Words (BoW)
2. Term Frequency–Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF)
3. N-gram

The following classification techniques were used on each of the feature engineering models (BOW, TF-IDF, N-gram):
1. Decision Tree
2. K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN)
3. Support Vector Machine (SVM)

The classification.pdf document consists of a detailed report of the project. The python notebook consists of the code and implementation.
